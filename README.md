- 👋 Hi, I’m @cd2mike or just Mike 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to understand how to communicate with my devices so I dont feel like the only american speaking person in a world full of people who speak latin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to research data and (just as impressively) forget, large amounts of programming data in my free time everyday. Then repeat this process the next day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have integrity based motives influencing an over all goal I also have made for my life which is to help bring trust back into the world!
- 📫 mike0421.mt@gmail.com is my email
